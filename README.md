# scale_free_network


A common feature of real world networks is the presence of hubs, or a few nodes that are highly connected to other nodes in the network. The presence of hubs will give the degree distribution a long tail, indicating the presence of nodes with a much higher degree than most other nodes.

Scale-free networks are a type of network characterized by the presence of large hubs. A scale-free network is one with a power-law degree distribution. For an undirected network, we can just write the degree distribution as
Pdeg(k)∝k−γ,
where γ is some exponent. This form of Pdeg(k) decays slowly as the degree k

increases, increasing the likelihood of finding a node with a very large degree.

Networks with power-law distributions a called scale-free1 because power laws have the same functional form at all scales. The power law Pdeg(k)
remains unchanged (other than a multiplicative factor) when rescaling the independent variable k, as it satisfies Pdeg(ak)=a−γPdeg(k).
